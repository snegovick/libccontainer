{"name":"Libccontainer","tagline":"Various data structures implemented in plain C","body":"Description\r\n=============\r\n\r\nWhy do these esoteric languages like C++ or Java or Python have cool libraries with lots of readily available implementations of data structures like Boost or STL or whatever and such a major language like C has just few such libs ? This projects aim is to change this situation. Hope you will find something useful.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n=====\r\n\r\n    cd libccontainer\r\n    bash ./bootstrap\r\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr # if you dont like autotools default (/usr/local)\r\n    make; make install\r\n\r\nWhats inside\r\n============\r\n\r\nWell tested:\r\n  * Linked list implementation\r\n  * Hash table implementation\r\n\r\nNot so well tested:\r\n  * Dynamic storage (malloc/free inside statically allocated buffer)\r\n  * Circular buffer\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
