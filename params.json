{"name":"Libccontainer","tagline":"Various data structures implemented in plain C","body":"Description\r\n=============\r\n\r\nWhy do these esoteric and hardly-ever-used languages like C++ or Java or Python have cool libraries with lots of readily available implementations of data structures like Boost or STL or whatever and such a major language like C has just few such libs ? This projects aim is to change this situation. I hope you will find something useful here, and feel free to contribute!\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n========\r\n\r\nExamples can be found at this page: http://uprojects.org/?page_id=17\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n=====\r\n\r\n    cd libccontainer\r\n    bash ./bootstrap\r\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr # if you dont like autotools default (/usr/local)\r\n    make; make install\r\n\r\nWhats inside\r\n============\r\n\r\nWell tested:\r\n  * Linked list implementation\r\n  * Hash table implementation\r\n\r\nNot so well tested:\r\n  * Dynamic storage (malloc/free inside statically allocated buffer)\r\n  * Circular buffer\r\n\r\nCross-compiling\r\n===============\r\n\r\nCross-compiling was tested on Ubuntu 14.04\r\n\r\n    cd libccontainer\r\n    bash ./bootstrap\r\n    ./configure --build=arm-none-eabi --disable-tests # disable tests for cross-compiling\r\n    make\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
